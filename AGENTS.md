# AGENTS: `thinking-tracer-tools`

## Project Overview

`thinking-tracer-tools` is a companion to the [`thinking-tracer` web application ](https://github.com/Brain-STM-org/thinking-tracer) that provides tools for extracting and processing LLM conversation traces.

We maintain libraries that help access to them, across client.  Our initial focus is Claude Code.

We will implement this in Golang and maintin a Taskfile.

Our first tool extracts a `PROMPTS.md` file from a Claude Code trace using a default template.

Released under the MIT license, see [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt).
