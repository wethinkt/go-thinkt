# AGENTS: `thinking-tracer-tools`

## Project Overview

`thinking-tracer-tools` is a companion to the [`thinking-tracer` web application ](https://github.com/Brain-STM-org/thinking-tracer) that provides tools for extracting and processing LLM conversation traces.

We maintain libraries that help access to them, across client.  Our initial focus is Claude Code.

We will implement this in Golang and maintin a Taskfile.

Our first tool extracts a `PROMPTS.md` file from a Claude Code trace using a default template.

Released under the MIT license, see [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt).

## Multi-Source Architecture

The tool supports multiple AI coding assistants:
- **Kimi Code** (`~/.kimi`)
- **Claude Code** (`~/.claude`)

Sources are automatically discovered. Use `--source kimi|claude` flags to filter commands.

### Environment Variables

Customize the storage locations using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `THINKT_KIMI_HOME` | Kimi Code data directory | `~/.kimi` |
| `THINKT_CLAUDE_HOME` | Claude Code data directory | `~/.claude` |

## Documentation Map

We maintain a series of Markdown documents to facilitate this project.

| File | Purpose | Editable |
|------|---------|----------|
| README.md | Human-readable project overview | Yes |
| AGENTS.md | Agent instructions (this file) | Yes |
| MEMORY.md | Long-term concepts and decisions | Yes |
| PLAN.md | Implementation planning | Yes |
| PROMPTS.md | Generated by tool or hook | **READ ONLY** |

### Research Reports

Persisted research reports are available in `etc/reports`.

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| [etc/reports/thinking-tracer.md](./etc/reports/thinking-tracer.md) | Architecture and features of the thinking-tracer visualization app |
| [etc/reports/go-patterns.md](./etc/reports/go-patterns.md) | Go project conventions from dbn-go and screentime-mcp |
